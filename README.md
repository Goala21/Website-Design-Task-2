Target audience:

This website targets individuals who are looking for a video editor to either edit their gaming videos, advertisements or vlogs.
They are offered three different bundles, the bronze, silver and gold package depending on what kind of editing they will require.
The portfolio will offer them a page where the potential client can view the seller's previous work to get an idea of how their videos will be
edited.




Navigation:

Throughout every webpage, a navbar was put on top of the page so the user can easily navigate through one webpage through the other with ease.
The navigation bar was done using one of bootstrap's classes.

Quiz
The quiz was built with HTML and CSS and coded using javascript.
The user has 4 multiple choice questions where they need to get all 4 answers correctly to be awarded with the 10% discount.

Once the user clicks on one of the answers, the button turns to dark grey to indicate that the button was clicked. This will also disable the other two answers from getting clicked to prevent the user from clicking more than one answer.
If the answer is correct, a point is added to the system and if incorrect, no points are added.
Once the user clicks the submit button, an alert pops up on top of the screen stating whether they have won their discount or not. 
Once they click on the "Submit" button, both the score, answers, and colours are reset and the user has the opportunity to try doing the quiz again if they've failed.


Contact us:

The contact us page was built using HTML and CSS and later on coded using Javascript.

Multiple field sections were created using HTML for the user to type in their name, surname, contact number, subject and message.

Java script was used so that once the user hits submit whilst having one or more input fields empty, they get an alert. It was also used to prevent users from typing in text instead of numbers in the contact section.

If all the fiels are filled in correctly and the submit button is clicked, the user will be redirected to outlook.


Home page

The home page was built using HTML and CSS.
This page contains the sellers information.
Each text in this page are contained in sections, to make each text and title more organised and with CSS, it was given background colour, shadow and a border radius to make it more visually appealing.


Our services

This page was built in using HTML and CSS.
Three packages were created: Bronze, Silver and Gold.
Each package is contained in a div, this makes it easier later on to add design to the package using CSS.
Each div contains a heather, price, pack contents and a button. The contents were done using a UL to make them organised.
Once the "get a quote" button is pressed, it will redirct you to the contact page to directly contact the seller about your video and how it needs to be edited.
